    Wrong answer in test #24

    When the player provides the correct initial game conditions and if Vergil goes first, your program should print 5 non-empty lines in such order:
    2 for Vergil
    1 for Vergil&#39;s move
    2 for Dante

    Please find below the output of your program during this failed test.
    Note that the &#39;&gt;&#39; character indicates the beginning of the input line.
